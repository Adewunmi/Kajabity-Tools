Kajabity-Tools
==============

A collection of miscellaneous code utilities and snippets.  Initially, there are only some C# (or .NET) utilities, but I will 
more collections in the future for other platforms - e.g. Java, JavaScript and Windows Store Apps.

These pieces of code are intended to be built as a library or cut and pasted wherever needed.
